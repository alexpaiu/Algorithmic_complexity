# Algorithmic Complexity

Week 10 will focus on an aspect of Computer Science that is relished by many developers, called algorithmic complexity.

This is the part of computer science that deals with how efficient programmes are. We will also take a deeper look at how programmes interact with memory, and how to use that to make our own programmes faster.

## Learning objectives
By the end of this week, the goal is to be able to answer "yes" to these questions:
..*Can you mention efficiency as one of the dimension of a good piece of code
 * Can you join a conversation about algorithms and their complexity?
